# Setting up DTOOL
DTOOL is the tree that contains low-level code that is needed by the rest of the engine and game trees. Building DTOOL requires for the desired third-party packages to be installed and configured beforehand.

First, clone the DTOOL repository:
```
cd %USERPROFILE%\player
git clone https://github.com/toontownretro/dtool
```

Attach to DTOOL, just like you did for WINTOOLS and ppremake:
```
cta dtool
```

Enter the DTOOL directory and let ppremake generate the scripts to build the tree:
```
cd %DTOOL%
ppremake
```

Finally, build the tree:
```
msbuild dtool.sln -m -t:install
```
*or*
```
jom install
```

After this completes, you should now have a fully built DTOOL tree in ``%DTOOL%\built``.
The rest of the trees build in almost the exact same process, so not much more explanation is needed from here on down.
